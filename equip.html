                    <p>Climbing shoes are crucial for climbing. They have rubber surfaces to prevent slipping by creating friction between the shoes and the wall. They normally need to be tight enough that the climber can feel the wall with their own feet but also need to be comfortable enough for the climber to do flexible footwork. Every type of climber, either indoor or outdoor, all need to wear these specialized shoes while climbing to ensure safety and sanitize for other climbers.</p>

                    <p>Chalk is commonly used among climbers to absorb palm sweat and therefore increase grip. This helps climbers not only climb for longer but also more efficiently. There are a variety of different types of chalk, and climbers have different preferences. The most common ones are: block chalk, loose chalk, chalk ball, etc.</p>

                    <p>Rope is used mainly by top-rope climbers and lead climbers. This equipment is used to hold and guarantee the safety of the person using it. A typical rope needs to be strong, and have enough friction to bear the weight of the climber. It's said that an ideal rope length is around 60 meters to 198 feet.<p>

                    <p>Climbers use harnesses to tie in the rope, ensuring safety. A climbing harness is typically designed to wrap around your waist and upper thigh to hold your weight and prevent your body from free-falling (while attached to a rope). It should be tightened to fit the user.</p>
