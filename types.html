        <h2>Types of Rock Climbing</h2>
        <h3>1. Bouldering</h3>

            <p>This might be the most popular type of climbing, especially for new climbers because of its simplicity, flexibility, and the stamina it brings. A boulder route is typically short (lasts around less than 1 minutes to complete) but involves a lot of movement and require strength and techniques to be optimized. Bouldering is climbing on shorter walls with no protection gear needed. All you need is a pair of <a href="shoes.jpg"><strong>climbing shoes</strong></a> and hop on the wall! Bouldering wall is available in most climbing gyms, with the starting grade V0 or font grade 3 (or VBeginner) to V17/9A (hardest available). However, since climbers will be climbing with no protection gear, there's inevitable that climbers will fall and face the ground (which is normally covered with soft pad). It's important that you know <a href="fall.html"><strong>how to safely fall</strong></a> before you practice this type of climbing.</p>

        <h3>2. Top-rope Climbing</h3>
        <div class="samp2">

            </figure>
            <p>Top rope is another type of climbing. This requires climbers to be slightly more equipped since it involves the use of ropes and a belay device. The climb also needed to be done with a partner as it requires a belayer and a climber. The belayer will have to hold on to the rope using a <a href="belay.jpg"><strong>belay device</strong></a> a catch the climber if they fall or need a rest mid climb. The climber will use the same <a href="ropes.jpg"><strong>rope</strong></a> attached to their <a href="harness.jpg"><strong>harness</strong></a> and climb on. Most climbing gyms providing top-rope routes require a belaying certificate.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>3. Lead Climbing</h3>
        <div class="samp1">
            <figure>

            <figcaption><i>aluxum, iStock</i></figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Lead climb is the main method climbers use when they climb big mountains and routes outdoor. This requires <a href="fall.html#outdoor-safety"><strong>heavy equipments and in-deep knowledge of their use</strong></a>. Climbers doing lead climb typically go in pair or in group. Like top-rope, there are a belayer and a climber in lead climbing, the only difference is the rope won't be secured in one part of the wall but the climber will have to attach the rope to different <a href="bolted-anchor.jpg"><strong>bolted anchors</strong></a> on the wall. This helps them have more freedom and can climb for a more extended distance. Lead climbing is more applied to outdoor climb because it allows more climbers can freely explore the route with their own equipments.</p>

        <h3>4. Free Soloing</h3>
        <div class="samp2">

            </figure>
            <p>A person acquire this type of climbing has to have the heart of a lion, because free soloing means that you'll always stand (or climb) face to face with the death. This type of climbing is exactly like its name. Free soloing means that the climber will conquer the entire route with little to no protection or gear. The difference between free solo and bouldering is the size of the route. While in bouldering, the routes are relatively small and only cause little to no damages if climbers fall (correctly), in free soloing, climbers will climb lead-climb routes with no protection and falling normally leads to heavy injury or even death. A legend who's most popular in this type of climbing is <a href="goats.html#Alex-Honnold"><strong>Alex Honnold</strong></a>.</p>
